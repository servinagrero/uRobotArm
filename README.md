# uRobotArm

## Final project for the subject Microprocesadores.

The idea of the project is to create a robot arm controlled by a STM32 nucleo. The frame of the robot arm is made out of 3D printed PLA.
The robot arm has 3 axis and can store and repeat positions. It also has an LED to simulate a tool.

Each axis is controlled by a potentiomenter and the actions can be triggered using the buttons connected to the board.

The positions are stored in a txt file and can be retrieved using the script `comunicacion_serial_stm32.py`.

Below are some images of the final result:
